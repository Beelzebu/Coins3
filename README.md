Coins3 is the continuation for the [Coins](https://github.com/Beelzebu/Coins) project.

With a completely new API and a better and optimized code this new projects aims to replace Coins. This project is almost
a completely rewrite of the original Coins plugin but keeps all features and will try to migrate everything that can
migrate from the old plugin.
